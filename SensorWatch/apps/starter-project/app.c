 * want to configure sensors on your sensor board here. For example, a low-power
 * accelerometer that will run at all times should be configured here, whereas you may
 * want to enable a more power-hungry environmental sensor only when you need it.
 *
 * @note If your app enters the Sleep or Deep Sleep modes, this function will be called
 * again on wake, since those modes will have disabled all pins and peripherals; you'll
 * likely need to set them up again. This function will also be called again if your app
 * entered the ultra-low power BACKUP mode, since BACKUP mode will have done all that and
 * also wiped out the system RAM. Note that when this is called after waking from sleep,
 * the RTC will still be configured with the correct date and time.
